<p>FIBONACCI SERIES</p>
<p>Sample Implementation of Fibonacci. Fibonacci Series is characterized by the fact that every number after the first two is the sum of the two preceding ones. two numbers. input n (highest number at which series has to end) Series : 0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89.....<br />Java Class : Fibonacci.java Three implementations<br />&nbsp; 1. Using loop. &nbsp;2. Using recursion. &nbsp;3. Using memoization.(Technique to improve speed of computation by storing complex calculation results)</p>

<p>PRIME NUMBER</p>
<p>Prime number is number which is only divisible by 1 and itself. eg : 2,3, 5, 7 , 11, ...<br />Java class : PrimeNumber.java<br />Check if number is divisible by each number from 2 to number -1;Check if number is divisible by 2, if yes , it is not prime. Next check, if number is divisible by odd numbers.Check if number is divisible by 2, if yes , it is not prime. Next check, if number is divisible by odd numbers till square root of number.</p>

<p>PALINDROME</p>
<p>Palindrome is word, number which is same forward and backword.&nbsp;eg 45654,abcba is palindrome&nbsp;eg 45655,abcbb is not palindorme<br />Java class : Palindrome.java<br />AMSTRONG NUMBER Number is called AmstrongNumber if , if digit is equal to sum of cubes of individual digits. &nbsp; eg 153= 1+ 125+27 &nbsp;( 1*1*1 &nbsp;+ 5*5*5 &nbsp;+ 3*3*3 ) Java Class : &nbsp;AmstrongNumber.java &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
