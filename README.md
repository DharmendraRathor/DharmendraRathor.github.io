# Java Programming Experiments 

A FIBONACCI SERIES

Sample Implementation of Fibonacci. Fibonacci Series is characterized by the fact that
every number after the first two is the sum of the two preceding ones. two
numbers. input n (highest number at which series has to end) Series :
0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89..... 

Java Class : Fibonacci.java
Three implementations 
1. Using loop. 
2. Using recursion. 
3. Using memoization.(Technique to improve speed of
   computation by storing complex calculation results)
   


B PRIME NUMBER

Prime number is number which is only divisible by 1 and itself.
eg : 2,3, 5, 7 , 11, ...

Implementation class : PrimeNumber.java

1. Check if number is divisible by each number from 2 to number -1;
2. Check if number is divisible by 2, if yes , it is not prime. 
	Next check, if number is divisible by odd numbers.
3. Check if number is divisible by 2, if yes , it is not prime. 
	Next check, if number is divisible by odd numbers till square root of number.
	
	
C PALINDROME
  
  Palindrome is word, number which is same forward and backword.
  eg 45654,abcba  is palindrome
  eg 45655,abcbb is not palindorme
